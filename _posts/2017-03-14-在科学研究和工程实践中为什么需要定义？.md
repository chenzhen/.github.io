## Science and engineering are not poetry

Science and engineering require good definitions: otherwise, how can we know we are really communicating?

First, science requires repeatable experiments, or provable theorems. How can one know that one has repeated the experiment if one does not know the semantics of the terms, or check the proof if one does not know the axioms?

Engineering development also requires shared understanding of terms. If we use the same words but mean different things, then we are confused, but may not even know it until we try to build something together. Science and engineering are not poetry. Moreover, an important principle is *designations without distinctions*. Our technical terms must differentiate one thing from another, otherwise this is another source of confusion.
