**一篇好论文的引言是相当公式化的**。如果你遵循一套简单的规则，你可以写一个很好的引言。下面的大纲可以是多种多样的。例如，你可以使用两段而不是一段，或者你可以把重点放在一个方面的介绍比另一个。但在所有的情况下，下面所有的要点都需要在引言中加以说明，而且在大多数的论文中，你不需要在介绍中包含更多的内容。

**第1段：动机**。在较高的水平，什么是你正在工作的问题领域，为什么它是重要的？在这里设置更大的上下文是很重要的。为什么更大的社区的利益和重要性的问题？ 

**第2段：本文所考虑的具体问题是什么？**这一段缩小了论文的主题范围。在第一段中，你确立了一般语境和重要性。这里你建立特定的背景和背景。 

**第3段：“在本文中，我们表明……(elevator pitch)”**。这是引言中的关键段落，在一段中，你在第1段和第2段所建立的上下文中，你的论文的主要贡献是什么？。一般采取的方法是什么？具体结果为何显著？这段话一定很不错。如果你不能在“入门”中的一段高水平地“推销”你的作品，那么你就有麻烦了。作为一个读者或审稿人，这是我一直在寻找的段落，并仔细阅读。 

你应该考虑如何构造这一段或两段你论文的全部概要。如果有两个或三个主要的结果，那么你可以按顺序考虑列他们（例如，“首先，…”）。如果结果大致分为两类，你可以在这里进行区别在。例如，“我们的结果既有理论意义，也有自然应用。（两个句子遵循，每一个关于理论和应用） 

**第4段：在高层次上描述你所做的工作和别人做的有什么区别**？把这个理由保持在一个较高的水平，你可以参考一个未来的部分将给出具体的细节和差异。但重要的是，保证读者在一个较高的水平，和其他工作相比较什么是这篇工作的创新点是什么。 

**第5段：“本文的其余部分的结构如下……”**(The remainder of this paper is structured as follows...)给读者的路线图的其余部分的文件。避免多余的措辞，“在第2节，在第3节，…在第4节，…等.

其它提示

不要花太多时间在介绍中告诉读者你在论文中没有做什么。清楚你所做的事情，但不要停留在你不做的事情上。

每个段落都有一个主题句，为整个段落设置了舞台吗？段落中的句子和主题是否相互关联？

你所有的时态都与段落相匹配吗？

### Writing a good introduction ###

A good paper introduction is fairly formulaic. If you follow a simple set of rules, you can write a very good introduction. The following outline can be varied. For example, you can use two paragraphs instead of one, or you can place more emphasis on one aspect of the intro than another. But in all cases, all of the points below need to be covered in an introduction, and in most papers, you don't need to cover anything more in an introduction.

Paragraph 1: Motivation. At a high level, what is the problem area you are working in and why is it important? It is important to set the larger context here. Why is the problem of interest and importance to the larger community?

Paragraph 2: What is the specific problem considered in this paper? This paragraph narrows down the topic area of the paper. In the first paragraph you have established general context and importance. Here you establish specific context and background.

Paragraph 3: "In this paper, we show that ...". This is the key paragraph in the intro - you summarize, in one paragraph, what are the main contributions of your paper given the context you have established in paragraphs 1 and 2. What is the general approach taken? Why are the specific results significant? This paragraph must be really really good. If you can't "sell" your work at a high level in a paragraph in the intro, then you are in trouble. As a reader or reviewer, this is the paragraph that I always look for, and read very carefully.

You should think about how to structure this one or two paragraph summary of what your paper is all about. If there are two or three main results, then you might consider itemizing them with bullets or in test (e.g., "First, ..."). If the results fall broadly into two categories, you can bring out that distinction here. For example, "Our results are both theoretical and applied in nature. (two sentences follow, one each on theory and application)"

Paragraph 4: At a high level what are the differences in what you are doing, and what others have done? Keep this at a high level, you can refer to a future section where specific details and differences will be given. But it is important for the reader to know at a high level, what is new about this work compared to other work in the area.

Paragraph 5: "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows..." Give the reader a roadmap for the rest of the paper. Avoid redundant phrasing, "In Section 2, In section 3, ... In Section 4, ... " etc.

A few general tips:

- Don't spend a lot of time into the introduction telling the reader about what you don't do in the paper. Be clear about what you do do, but don't dwell here on what you don't do.
- Does each paragraph have a theme sentence that sets the stage for the entire paragraph? Are the sentences and topics in the paragraph all related to each other?
- Do all of your tenses match up in a paragraph?

### Stanford InfoLab's patented five-point structure for Introductions. ###

1. What is the problem?
1. Why is it interesting and important?
1. Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
1. Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
1. What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations. 

Then have a final paragraph or subsection: "Summary of Contributions". It should list the major contributions in bullet form, mentioning in which sections they can be found. This material doubles as an outline of the rest of the paper, saving space and eliminating redundancy.
